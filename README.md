# odin-recipes
Odin Proj recipes project

Goals of the project were to practice basic HTML page set up with proper usage of html, head, body sections as a boiler plate, as well as correct usage of basic tags; p, ol, li, img, a. It was a good review and good practice at NOT styling or obsessing (too much) over increasing functionality based on past HTML/CSS experience. 

The best practice was in both using Git to stage new files in my terminal and push up to Github, and getting used to the interplay between my terminal and VSCode and which program needs to do what on the old system I have. i.e. working on HTML files in VSCode, but using git to add and stage, then VSCode to do the commit message, then terminal to push to Github.
