    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>50g bubbly, active starter</li>
        <li>365g warm water</li>
        <li>480g bread flour</li>
        <li>20g whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>9g fine sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Fillings
        <li>65g raisins</li>
        <li>65g walnuts</li>
        <li>50g sugar</li>
        <li>6g cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>Process
        <li>Whisk starter and water together in large bowl with a fork.</li>
        <li>Add flour and salt, combine until stiff dough forms.</li>
        <li>Cover with damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li>While dough resting, soak raisins and walnuts in just enough warm water to cover. Drain well before use.</li>
        <li>Add raisins and nuts to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Gently knead fillings into dough to incorporate, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Bulk rise - Cover the bowl with damp towel and let rise at room temperature until double in size. About 8-10 hours in 70 degrees.</li>
        <li>Dump dough onto lightly floured surface and let rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Line a 10-inch oval proofing basket with towel and dust with flour.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Gently stretch dough into long rectangle, lightly brush surface of dough with water.</li>
        <li>Evenly sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture over the top, leaving 2-inch border top and bottom, and 1-inch border around sides.</li>
        <li>With short end facing you, roll dough into a log, pinching ends to seal. Place in basket, seam side up.</li>
        <li>Second rise - Cover dough and let rest 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees and cut parchment paper to fit baking pot.</li>
        <li>Place parchment over dough and turn basket to release onto paper.</li>
        <li>Make 2-3 diagonal shallow cuts (scores) into surface of dough with small knife.</li>
        <li>Transfer into baking pot.</li>
        <li>Bake covered for 20 minutes, then uncovered for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove loaf to wire rack and cool for 1 hour before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
